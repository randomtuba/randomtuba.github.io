    <b>Algebraic Progression</b><br>
    In this game, you start with a few buildings and must gain X and Y to unlock new content!<br>
    This game has a collection of achievements, many mechanics, automation, and a prestige layer.<br>
    <span style="font-size: 10px;">oh yeah and also part of it doesn't work</span><br>

    <a href="https://yahtzeemaster26.github.io/algebraic-progression/">Classic Version</a><br><br>
    <b>Prestige Game</b><br>
    This game is somewhat similar to Algebraic Progression, however is simpler and I believe it's shorter.<br>
    Gather buildings and collect b as you gain more upgrades and achievements along the way.<br>
    <span style="font-size: 10px;">this game got abandoned</span><br>

    <b>Tuba's Tree</b><br>
    I decided to make my own TMT (The Modding Tree) mod and I'm actually proud of this one.<br>
    Originally inspired by a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/455787851/">Scratch game I made</a>, you travel through 4 prestige layers, collecting<br>
    resources and unlocking new mechanics. There are a total of 45 achievements.<br>

    <b>Tuba's Tree Rewritten</b><br>
    This is going to be a bigger and better version of Tuba's Tree, with new layers and more content.<br>
    I am currently not working on this game, however I plan to return to it soon.<br>

    <b>Tree, Inc.</b><br>
    In this game, you run a small business as it slowly builds up into a dystopian empire controlling the world through nightmarish capitalism.<br>
    This game is not done yet, but I plan for this game to have up to 6 rows.<br>
    <span style="font-size: 10px;">yes this is another TMT mod</span><br>

    <b>My Scratch Account</b><br>
    Below is the link to my Scratch account. Here you will find small games that bring about 5 minutes of fun.<br>
    If you're going to make fun of me using Scratch, then get outta here. I don't wanna deal with you whining.<br>
